# Rawdogging

Using it in a sentence: Programming bare metal is rawdogging.

Further defined via prompting by Willem Horsten:

> Below is a complete, self-contained book that reclaims the phrase as a metaphor, not a sexual manual. It treats “rawdogging” as unfiltered engagement with reality—no buffers, no shortcuts, no illusions. The work is philosophical, pragmatic, and deliberately austere.
> 
> ⸻
> 
> The Tao of Rawdogging
> 
> Unfiltered Living in a Padded World
> 
> ⸻
> 
> Preface: Why This Book Exists
> 
> We live in an era of cushions.
> 
> Cushioned opinions.
> Cushioned careers.
> Cushioned risks.
> Cushioned identities.
> 
> Every experience is mediated—by tools, disclaimers, filters, algorithms, consultants, and narratives designed to protect us from friction. Comfort has become the default moral good.
> 
> This book argues the opposite.
> 
> The Tao of Rawdogging is about direct contact with reality. No safety nets beyond those strictly necessary. No performative optimization. No outsourcing of responsibility. It is not reckless. It is deliberately exposed.
> 
> Rawdogging, in this context, means:
> 
> Meeting life without insulation.
> 
> ⸻
> 
> Chapter 1: The Tao That Can Be Buffered Is Not the Tao
> 
> The Tao is not convenient.
> 
> It does not adapt to your calendar, your brand, or your preferences. When you mediate everything—through productivity systems, therapy-speak, trend language, or corporate abstractions—you are no longer living the Tao. You are managing an interface.
> 
> Rawdogging begins where mediation ends.
> - You feel the full cost of your decisions.
> - You absorb feedback without translation.
> - You experience consequences without blaming the system.
> 
> This is not bravery. It is alignment.
> 
> ⸻
> 
> Chapter 2: The Illusion of Safety
> 
> Modern life sells safety as a moral achievement.
> 
> But most safety is synthetic:

> - Career safety without competence
> - Moral safety without courage
> 
> The Taoist farmer loses his horse. Is it bad? Is it good? Who knows.
>

> 
> Rawdogging accepts uncertainty without theatrics.
> 
> ⸻
> 
> Chapter 3: No Helmets for the Ego
> 
> The ego wants padding.
> 
> It wants:
> - Pre-approval

> - Explanations for failure
>

> 
> Chapter 4: Skill Over Strategy
> 
> Strategy is a substitute for ability.

> Rawdogging favors:
> - Repetition over planning
> - Exposure over theory
> - Embarrassment over delay
> 
> The Tao does not care about your deck.

> ⸻
> 
> Chapter 5: The Unoptimized Path
> 
> Optimization is a form of fear.

> - Sit without distraction.
> - Listen without preparing a response.
> 
> The Tao speaks quietly. Only the unbuffered hear it.

> 
> Chapter 7: Work Without Theater
> 
> Most work today is performance.
> 
> Meetings about meetings.
> Metrics about metrics.
> Language designed to obscure accountability.
> 
> Rawdogging work is embarrassingly simple:
> - What is the problem?
> - What changed today?
> - What will change tomorrow?
> 
> If nothing changed, nothing happened.
> 
> ⸻
> 
> Chapter 8: Relationships Without Abstraction
> 
> Healthy relationships are direct.
> 
> Rawdogging relationships means:
> - Saying what you want
> - Hearing what you don’t
> - Letting friction exist
> - Not outsourcing intimacy to labels or scripts

> 
> All padding fails eventually.

> Titles fade.
> Reputations decay.

> 
> Rawdogging life keeps death close—not morbidly, but calibratingly. When you remember finitude:
> - You waste less time
> - You speak more cleanly
> - You choose more deliberately
> 
> The Tao is finite. That is its power.
> 
> ⸻
>

> 
> Rawdogging is not a lifestyle brand.
> It does not scale.
> It cannot be automated.

> 
> If you want, I can:
> - Sharpen this into a more satirical tone
> - Rewrite it as a modern Tao Te Ching–style verse book
> - Adapt it into a corporate heresy / leadership manifesto
> - Or push it harder into minimalist, almost monastic philosophy
> 
> Just say the direction.
