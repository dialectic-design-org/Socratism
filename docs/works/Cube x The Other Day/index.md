# Description

*Cube x The Other Day* is a self-initiated project. It is a series of works, capturing the output of an audio-reactive visual synthesiser which generates cubes based on various parameters. The series consists of a total of 13 works, each based on one of the tracks of the Jeff Mills axis compilation album *The Other Day* from 1997.

## Context

These works are created as part developing and establishing initial process and technique for the Socratism artistic project. Captured and documented to establish reference points for key concepts in the broader artistic project.

## Method

Iterative shape improvisation interacting with tool, technique and technology development.



---

## Setup

Works were created and captured digitally with the following setup:

- Cube synthesizer in [Hyperobjects MacOS toolkit](https://github.com/dialectic-design-org/HyperobjectsMacOS).
- Music from Jeff Mills album *[The Other Day (Axis compilation)](https://www.discogs.com/master/5953-Jeff-Mills-The-Other-Day-Axis-Compilation?srsltid=AfmBOopCyabB2P6WZ2Xjbg6A174q9s_QU6oCRbbk0xzuHCyIC7DPng8m)*.
- Script to live-tune synthesizer parameters via code.
- VSCode to edit the script file.
- Macbook to run the synthesizer, music and capture the recording. 
- Post-processing via ffmpeg.

## Process

**Preparation**

Before these works were conceived, the cube visual synthesizer was first created as part of the technique & technology development in the [Hyperobjects MacOS toolkit](https://github.com/dialectic-design-org/HyperobjectsMacOS). 

In developing the visual synthesizer, a large variety of input parameters and transforms for cubes were combined into a single script or 'algorithm'.

The synthesizer has the possibility to define a single cube or an ordered set of cubes, with further parameters controlling how the cube parameters are applied to the full set of cubes, with potentially the position of the cube within the set affecting the parameter as well.

**Works**

Each piece has been created sequentially in the order of the album.

**Per work**

Iteratively a sequence of parameters are found which tune the cube synthesizer to produce a visualisation which matches the feeling of the music.

After the parameters are found, a final recording is made.

Over the duration of the audio track, parameters are changed so that the visualisation develops together with the audio of the track.

**Between works**

Explore variants of cube synthesis which have not been expressed yet in previous tracks.

**Publishing**

Captured recordings are added to the Socratism works catalog with title and description.

## Choices

As part of the broader development of the artistic practice, choices made in these works are described and reflected upon.

**Choice of Cube as visual structure**

Minimal starting point.

**Choice of Jeff Mills music as ...**

Experimental music to latch onto. Sonically varied, minimal, dissonant, immediate, alien, rhytmic & repetitive.

**Choice of Live parameter control during recording**

Preparation for live performance.

**Choice of Parameter changes during the track**

Even though these are minimalist instrumental tracks, there is an order to sounds coming in. Minimalist music needs time/repetition for the mind to recognise the structure in repetitions and changes in patterns.

**Choice of Naming**

```
Collection name:
Cube x {{Album name}}

Work name:
Cube x {{Track name}}
```

Direct reference to source material and subject.



## Showing notes

Works can be experienced as media pieces via personal devices in the order of viewer preference.

In exhibition format, works can be shown sequentially as a long-form movie or positioned separately, however care should be taken for accompanying audio to be transmitted in a way that parallel setups do not interfere with each other.

Collection can also be used as basis for presentations & lectures about digital, audio-reactive art.
